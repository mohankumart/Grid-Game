# Grid-Game

There will be n X n grid board filled with n*n-1 cells filled with unique random numbers and an empty cell placed randomly on the grid as shown in following image. User can move the cell to empty place by clicking on it. Movable cells can be horizontally or vertically adjacent to empty cell(In the below example, 9, 4, 11 and 7 can be movable). User has to arrange all the numbers in ascending order to win the game.
- Game should have multiple difficulty levels(Easy - 3X3 grid, Medium - 4X4 grid and hard - 5X5 grid)
- Game should notify end of the game once user places all the numbers in ascending order.
- User should have option to start 'New Game" which fills the grid with randomly shuffled numbers.
